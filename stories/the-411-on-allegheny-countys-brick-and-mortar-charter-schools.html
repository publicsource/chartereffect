                City Charter High School is the highest-achieving charter school in Allegheny County and the highest-achieving school in the city of Pittsburgh. The school is often described as “technology infused” and since its founding year has given each student a laptop that they keep upon graduation. The school has a non-traditional school year with 13-week trimesters and the months of December, April and August off. Its focus is on preparing students for the workplace or college by teaching personal skills such as punctuality and compliance with a business casual dress code. School days are longer than typical, running from 7:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. Starting in 10th grade, students can take honors courses in math, English, history and science. Students also graduate with skills in word processing, spreadsheets, digital video production and PowerPoint presentations. During senior year, students work independently in order to learn time management skills they can use in higher education or the workplace.

                As evidenced by its name, the Environmental Charter School has a curriculum that is based on ecological literacy along with critical thinking. Students are frequently outside of the classroom, sometimes in Frick Park, which lies adjacent to the Upper School with grades 4-8. Students also visit other areas of the city to work on projects. The curriculum is interdisciplinary and project-based. That means students work for a length of time on projects that involve critical thinking, such as one they participated in this spring exploring whether the lunar landing was a hoax. There is an emphasis on sustainability at the school. Students compost, and the school has been on the forefront of testing its water supplies for lead and replacing fixtures even in areas where lead fell into <a href="http://publicsource.org/some-pittsburgh-area-charter-schools-active-in-lead-reduction-others-standing-still/" target="_blank">acceptable levels</a>. Unlike the other charter schools in Allegheny County, which serve student populations that are majority black and economically disadvantaged, Environmental Charter School’s student body is 69 percent white and 30 percent economically disadvantaged. In 2018, the school plans to add a second K-8 school and a 9-12 school. Pittsburgh Public Schools had fought the charter for the new schools, but dropped the opposition earlier this year when school officials promised to diversify the student body.

                While Hill House Passport Academy is open to all students, the program is designed for students from ninth grade up to age 21 who have dropped out, been expelled or for other reasons have not been able to complete a high school education. Students attend class on-site for three hours and are required to work another three hours online five days a week. They also perform 20 hours of community service per school year. School officials take attendance daily and monitor the students’ online hours as well. Students are grouped into advisories, where a group of eight students are assigned to one teacher. The goal of the program is to move students into employment, trade school or other post-secondary education.

                Manchester Academic is one of the three original charter schools in Allegheny County. Its charter called for a K-8, which was a different model for the city at the time, said CEO/Principal Vasilios Scoumis. It draws about 90 percent of its students from the North Side neighborhoods. Of its students, 96 percent are black and 100 percent are economically disadvantaged. It is located in space it leases from the Manchester Youth Development Center, which has an after-school program that most of the students attend. Each student has an “individual education profile,” with a plan that “meets them where they need to be met,” Scoumis said. The school won a U.S. Department of Education No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon in 2008 for growth in academic achievement. In recent years, Scoumis said test scores have declined because of the switch to the Pennsylvania Core Curriculum and the alignment of state tests to that curriculum. Instead of suspensions, the school uses restorative justice practices through which students go in front of a panel of their peers. In 2018, middle school students will move to the renovated second floor of the former Allegheny branch of the Carnegie Library, where students will be immersed in the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/04/10/Allegheny-Carnegie-Library-reopening-North-Side-Pittsburgh-Childrens-Museum/stories/201704100006" target="_blank">expanded Children’s Museum’s Makeshop lab</a>. In the lab, students will be able to create such items as voice-activated robots and fiber-optic clothing.

                The school runs under the motto: “We CARE,” which stands for its core values of character, academics, relationships and teaching entrepreneurship to foster leadership, Allen said. Penn Hills Charter is a four-star <a href="http://www.microsociety.org/" target="_blank">MicroSociety school</a>, where students in kindergarten through fifth grade run their own democratic republic society. Each year, the students elect a government to run the school. After being sworn in, the students create laws for the school and, for one period a day, they run their own society, where they have businesses and get paid in school dollars. In the middle school, the <a href="https://nfte.com/" target="_blank">Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship</a> curriculum is used. In sixth grade, students learn career and job readiness, how to search for a job and determine what they’re good at. By seventh grade, students start looking at colleges and try to figure out how much money they would need to make if they want to be successful in a given career. In eighth grade, students write a business plan. Class sizes are capped at 24 students. Each grade level, which includes two classrooms, has an instructional support teacher who assists with small group instruction and enrichment.In 2017-18, the school will go one-to-one for grades 2 to 8, where each student will have a Chromebook assigned to them.</p>

                <p class="modal-intro">The school moved from the old William Penn Elementary building to the former Washington Elementary school in 2016-17. The school plans to expand to eighth grade in 2017-18 for its final level of expansion.

                Provident Charter School opened in fall 2016 at the site of the former North Catholic High School, which Provident bought for $2 million. It is designed to serve students with dyslexia and other reading struggles, though it accepts all students. Provident’s School Performance Profile score for its first year in operation, 2016-17, should be released in the fall.
                The battle to start the school took six years, with its first charter application denied by the North Hills school board in 2012 and a second charter application denied by the Pittsburgh school board in 2014. But Board President Curtis Kossman, a real estate developer, appealed and won approval for the school from Commonwealth Court in February 2016. Kossman and his two children have <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2011/03/07/Group-works-to-create-charter-school-for-children-with-dyslexia/stories/201103070409" target="_blank">dyslexia</a>.</p>

                <p class="modal-intro">The school opened with third and fourth grades. Marcoux said those grades are when students’ reading disabilities surface. Fifth grade will be added this year and, by 2021, the school hopes to have grades 2-8. Marcoux said all students get reading remediation every day and that there is one teacher for every six students.

                Spectrum Charter School did not allow a visit or provide information about its program. But based on information from its website, its mission is to provide a school-to-work transition for students ages 13 to 21 with autism or other cognitive difficulties. Classes have one special education teacher and one paraprofessional for every eight students. 
                The school does not get a School Performance Profile score because, as a school for students with special needs, it does not earn enough possible points to be assigned a score.
                From 2012 to 2016, 24 students graduated. Half of the graduates went on to workshops or habilitation services where they learn or improve skills for daily living. A quarter of the graduates are employed and 8.5 percent are in post-secondary education. 
                In 2015, the school received the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2015/12/18/Green-education-initiative-launched-by-Spectrum-Charter-School/stories/201512110021" target="_blank">Green Flag Award</a> from the National Wildlife Federation for the school’s efforts in educating students to care for the environment.

                Urban Academy is one of the three original charter schools in the county. It was founded by African-American leaders and educators to provide quality education to black students using an Afrocentric curriculum. It started with the backing of the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh located in a former East Liberty synagogue. Founded as the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh Charter School, it broke away from the Urban League and changed its name in August 2015. The school moved to new leased location in Larimer in fall 2016, where there is space for state-of-the-art programs in science, music, drama and art. Its student body is 97 percent black and 77 percent economically disadvantaged.    
                </p>
                <p class="modal-intro">In December 2015, former Pittsburgh Public Schools Superintendent Linda Lane commended the Urban Academy on its academic achievement and its third-grade reading proficiency scores. The comments came after the A+ Schools advocacy group released a report that showed Urban Academy’s academic outcomes were above the district’s average. But the overall SPP score at Urban Academy has tumbled from 85.5 in 2012-13 to 48.3 in 2015-16. Patterson blames the decline on inadequate preparation for the switch to the Pennsylvania Core curriculum and the state tests aligned to the curriculum. </p>

                Urban Pathways K-5 College Charter School encourages students to think about college from their first days in classes. Each year, students are assigned an Historically Black College and University school to research, and the school holds an annual college fair with representatives from a variety of institutions of higher education. Classes are small with one teacher for every 10 students. The school is located on Penn Avenue in the Downtown theater district and students visit the art galleries, theaters and parks. In June, the school graduated its first class of students who attended from kindergarten through fifth grade. Enrollment is 97 percent black and 94 percent economically disadvantaged. Fitzgerald said about 10 percent of the students are homeless.

                Urban Pathways was one of the three original charter schools in Allegheny County. It started as Northside Urban Pathways and was different for its 6-12 model — a model created to eliminate the transition from middle school to high school. Its student enrollment is 99 percent black and 65 percent economically disadvantaged. The school fosters partnerships with community organizations and businesses and uses them for shadowing and internship opportunities for students. It features small classes with a student-to-teacher ratio of 12:1. Former CEO Linda Clautti resigned in March 2014, several months after a KDKA-TV <a href="http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/11/08/kd-investigation-gets-results-state-calls-for-fbi-probe-of-charter-school/" target="_blank">investigation</a> showed that tens of thousands of school dollars were used to pay for meals at expensive restaurants, board retreats at exclusive resorts, cell phones for board members and their spouses and to develop a second school in Ohio. The board later enacted checks-and-balances procedures to prevent future misuse of school funds.

                Young Scholars of McKeesport Charter School opened in 2015 as a sister school to Young Scholars of Western Pennsylvania Charter School in Baldwin Township, which has been around for six years. The goal was to offer a similar multilingual, multicultural experience to students in McKeesport and its surrounding neighborhoods, Demir said. The school focuses on teaching foreign language, with all students learning Turkish and Spanish, and training them to become global citizens, he said. This summer, the school received a <a href="https://startalk.umd.edu/public/find-a-summer-program/young%2520scholars" target="_blank">$50,000 STARTALK grant</a> that allowed it to host summer school to teach Turkish to students from the area. The summer sessions were held at the Baldwin Township school. Young Scholars of McKeesport also focuses on offering a safe educational environment to its students who sometimes come from troubled neighborhoods, Demir said. In 2017-18, a teacher’s aide will be added to each classroom. The school will have a 1:9 ratio of certified teachers to students. The school also has a one-to-one technology program, where each student is assigned their own Chromebook computer during the day. However, the students do not take the computers home at night. The school, located in a rented building from the St. Nicholas Byzantine Church, in 2016-17 began using Reading Mastery, an intense phonics program for grades K-2 in an effort to help improve student reading.

                <p class="modal-intro">
                In the 2017-18 school year, the school will add a sixth grade. The plan is for the school to expand to a K-8 school in three years.

               At the multilingual, multicultural charter school, students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade take Turkish and Spanish classes once a day. “The main mission is the foreign languages,” Biyikli said. Flags from across the world hang in the school’s gymnasium/cafeteria, and students often participate in multicultural events. Each classroom is assigned a country and studies it for a month. Students learn songs and dances from countries around the world and perform them for their peers. The program culminates in an international celebration. With students learning Turkish and Spanish, parents now are attempting to learn them, too, school leaders said. In 2016-17, the school held a six-week Turkish cooking class — taught by its Turkish teacher — for parents. The school also focuses on an individual approach to learning, Board President Melih Demirkan said. Class sizes are capped at 22. The school offers a free extended day program Monday through Thursday with clubs and tutoring for students, along with a 16-week academic support program held on Saturdays. The school has a one-to-one program for its middle school, where each student is assigned a Chromebook to use during the day. In grades K-5, Chromebook carts are available for teachers to use, along with a computer lab. Smartboards are in almost every classroom.

Residents at the time raised concerns, citing news reports, that the school’s “sister school” in State College was under investigation for its ties to Turkish leaders. Demirkan said the concerns haven’t come up since. “No one is asking about it anymore,” he said. “It has been a long time. No one ever says anything.”</p>
